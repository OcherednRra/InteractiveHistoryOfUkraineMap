[Full text](docs/Поляков.Валентин.ІО15.pdf)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my bachelor's diploma project. The project is an interactive web application that provides information on Ukraine's military history through an interactive map.

## Description

In this project, modern cartographic platforms were explored and their features and limitations analyzed. Based on this analysis, tools were selected to develop an informational-reference system on Ukraine's military history in the form of an interactive map. The architecture of the database, server-side, and web application was analyzed, ensuring the system's stability, performance, and usability. The software product was developed using JavaScript with React, Node.js, and SQLite.
Keywords: interactive map, web application, military history, JavaScript, React, Mapbox.
The system is designed for educational and research purposes, allowing users to explore historical events via an interactive map interface. It supports user contributions, editing, and advanced search functionalities.

## Features
* Intuitive User Interface: Simple and user-friendly design for easy navigation.
* Interactive Map Navigation: Zooming, panning, and exploration of historical events on a map powered by Mapbox.
